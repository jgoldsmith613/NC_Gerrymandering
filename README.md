# Optaplanner - Colorado Gerrymandering

This application runs using data from the US Census Bureau.

The App is run from com.rhc.gerrymandering.app.GerrymanderingApp.java. Please start there when looking through the code.

The GerrymanderingSolution and the Block class in the domain package are the main Optaplanner classes.

You may notice several classes and config files that mention Polygons, please ignore those, as those were just experimentations I have not gotten to work yet. They are not used anywhere as currently configured.
